# Finite-State-Machines

A finite state machine is a computational model for a machine that is *always in a fixed state*. Each finite state machine has a finite number of states and can only ever be in one state at a point in time.

The state of a finiter state machine will change depending on the current state and the input data. If the input data is valid, the finite state machine will terminate in an accepting state.

A finite state machine's state can change and does so according to transition rules, rules that describe what a finite state machine should do given certain criteria.
